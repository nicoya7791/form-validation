# Teamtreehouse Project 3 Interective Form Validation.

## My third project in Teamtreehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree.

In this project I created a customized validation for this form's required fields
- Adding customized and conditional behavior.
- Validated user input by providing the user error messeges.

## Required fields validation

1. The **name**, **email**, **zip code**, **cvv**, and **credit card number** input field  were added a real time keyup listener event. Error will display as the user type.
2. The **name** field can not be blank or empty.
3. The **credit card number field** also has a **customized error messege** that triggers when the user input dashes in the card numbers.
4. The **activity field** after the user selects an activity, other activities with the same day and time are added the classes disable and the label input field is disabled, to avoid any conflicts.
