# Teamtreehouse Project 3 Interective Form Validation.

## My third project in Teamtreehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree.

In this project I created a customized validation for this form's required fields
- Adding customized and conditional behavior.
- Validated user input by providing the user error messeges.
## Exceed expectation tasks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
- The **activity field** after the user selects an activity, other activities with the same day and time are disable to avoid conflicts.
- The **credit card number field** has a **customized error message**. It triggers when the user enters dashes in the card numbers. It prompts the user the enter numbers without dashes.
- The following input fields have real time validation
1. **name field** it must not be empty
2. **email field**
3. **zip Code**
4. **cvv**
5. **credit card number**
